# Bachelor thesis on individual crowdfunding success factors

Crowdfunding is getting more and more popular as a way of alternative financing. Those who understand the rules and dynamics of crowdfunding environments and platforms, have a big advantage and can finance projects without much liability. By looking at the literature it is clear, that there are many studies about crowdfunding success factors. But most studies tried to extract overarching success factors, that can be applied to all crowdfunding means.

My bachelor thesis and research supplements this approach by providing a tool for crowdfunding creators to extract individual success factors for a specific crowdfunding idea, field or geographical location. To achieve this a web-scraper in R was developed that made it possible to extract projects from Kickstarter, which are filtered by a freely chosen search term, category or location. The result is a unique dataset which enables creators to extract deeper insights by applying statistical methods.

The bachelor thesis was written in German and all the code was written inside R.

# Example data and code
The framework was tested by collecting projects that tried to finance the design, production and distribution of playing cards on Kickstarter. The collected data can be seen inside the `example-data` folder.
